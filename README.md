# Infecto : A Computational Simulation of Virus Transmission

## Introduction

This is a simulation of how a virus spread over the population. The simulation is heavily inspired by the SIR model.
We have three different states of each agent (a person & virus). 
The first state is SUSCEPTIBLE, second one is SICK, and the last one is RECOVERED. We have also a DEAD state in this simulation.

## Technologies Used
* Repast Simphony
* Java
* Trello

## Future Scope
* Refine the system by adding public places like hospitals, shopping complex  and home and its effects on simulation
* Adding the concept of social distancing and self isolation in flattening the curve.
* Evolve the agents (both virus and human) to simulate second phase of infection
